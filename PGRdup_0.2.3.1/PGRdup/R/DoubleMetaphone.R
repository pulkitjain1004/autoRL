#' Double Metaphone Phonetic Algorithm
#' 
#' \code{DoubleMetaphone} converts strings to double metaphone phonetic codes.
#' 
#' An implementation of the Double Metaphone phonetic algorithm in \code{R}. The
#' presence of non-ASCII characters is detected and indicated as a warning.
#' 
#' @param str A character vector whose strings are to be encoded by double 
#'   metaphone algorithm.
#' @return Returns a list with two character vectors of the same length as the
#'   input vector. The first character vector contains the primary double
#'   metaphone encodings, while the second character vector contains the 
#'   alternate encodings.
#' @seealso \code{\link[stringdist]{phonetic}},
#'   \code{\link[RecordLinkage]{phonetics}}
#' @section Acknowledgement: The \code{C} code for the double metaphone
#'   algorithm was adapted from Maurice Aubrey's perl module hosted at the
