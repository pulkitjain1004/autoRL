PGRdup 0.2.3
---------------------------------------
###UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
 - `KWCounts` - Fixed error in case of large number of exceptions and fixed bug regarding non-exact removal of keyword exceptions.
 - `ProbDup` - Changed code with a column vector specifying the columns having `with=FALSE` argument to the new preferred syntax in `data.table`.
 - `ViewProbDup` - Fixed error 'formal argument "axis.ticks.y" matched by multiple actual arguments'.
 - `ViewProbDup` - Fixed bug in case when all factor names in `select` argument are not present in `factor.db1` and/or `factor.db2`, the function stops. Now it gives an warning and stops only when none of the factor names in `select` are present in `factor.db*`.
 
###OTHER NOTES:
 - Added `rmarkdown` to suggests field in DESCRIPTION, as prompted by Jan GÃ³recki.
