# Record Linkage

This repository consist of my R scripts which I have developed while working with Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station.

Record linkage (RL) is the task of finding records in a data set that refer to the same entity across different data sources (e.g., data files, books, websites, and databases).
My work is concentrated on linking same people in multiple databases.

The codes is split in 4 major files.
1) How to build positive/negative pairs
2) Generating features for those pairs
3) Running either svm or random forests

Note: At the end of each code, output is saved in a csv format. This file is read in the next code.
