Build new feature to account for last name change for females and birth state jaro winkler for all.

If gender.x == gender.y && first_name && age_range && birth_state
	gender == f: feature = 0 if normalised dist < 0.5 else 1 (gives slightly better result)
	feature: JW of State, think
	gender ==f: JW of middle name
	gender ==f, JW of last name and middle name

* Birth state are wrongly coded!


Female rule based:
   true

In general rule based is giveing better performance, both when using female exclusive or general.
